## R Markdown

# This is my level 1 Heading

## This is my Level 2 Heading

This is my main test POLI3148

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Inputting your code here

```{r}
log(50)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Output Figures 

```{r}
plot(1:10,1:10)
```

## Display Data

```{r}
cars
```

### In-line R codes 

Scientific research shows that 12223+12111 = r

12223+12111.

```{r}
# install.packages("tinytex")
# tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
